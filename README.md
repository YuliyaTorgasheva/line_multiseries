Some examples of line multiseries (subplots) charts to use instead of 'spagetti' ones

<p>Uzbekistan demonstrates remarkable growth rates in the higher education market. Until the mid-2010s, the country lagged significantly behind other CIS countries, but now the gap has not only been closed — the number of students per 10,000 population in Uzbekistan is higher than in Russia or Kazakhstan. It has increased more than fourfold over 10 years, from 85 people in 2013 to 361 people per 10,000 population in 2023. In Russia, there are currently 296 students per 10,000 population, in Kazakhstan — 298, and in Kyrgyzstan — 344. Substantial deregulation in higher education and economic growth are the key factors behind the increase in student numbers.

<p> To demonstrate higher education dynamics in post-Soviet countries, I use multiseries charts made with Plotly.
